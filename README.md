Comparison of Watershed and K-Means on basis of SSIM for detection of Brain Tumours from MR Images is a research work which we carried out to compare the two of the copmmonly used segmentation techniques on the basis of structural similarity indexing method. 
We have written the code in python3.0 using the openCV and NumPy modules. 
This paper delves deeper into the watershed segmentation technique, k-means segmentation technique and SSIM.
This study has found the  SSIM of 0.8762 between the ground truth and waterhsed segmented images. And the SSIM between K-Means segmented image and Ground Truth image was found to be 0.7964.
SSIM between the K-Menas and Watershed segmented images was found to be 0.8548.
