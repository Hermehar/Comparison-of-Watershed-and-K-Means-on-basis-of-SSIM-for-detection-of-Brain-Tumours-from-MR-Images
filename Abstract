Detecting brain tumours is a very tedious task and to ease up the process of the detection, many researchers use up different machine learning techniques to detect the tumours from the images of various radiological scans. The machine learning models mostly use the image segmentation for the detection prior to training the model. We have tried to compare the two segmentation approaches on the basis of structural similarity indexing method. In our study, we found that Watershed Segmentation technique has performed well as compared to the K-Means on the raw images.
